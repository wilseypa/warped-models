Introduction
------------

Details to be added later ( hopefully :) ).


NOTE: It has been assumed that all locations are connected to each other in 
a star topology configuration to a central hub. This has been done to reduce
complexity in design of diffusion network.

Travel time from location 1 to location 2 = 
                     Travel time from location 1 to central hub +
                     Travel time from central hub to location 2


Configuration File
------------------

The model generator program lets the user adjust the following parameters
before writing out the model:

<transmissiblity>
<number_of_regions>
foreach region 1..<no_of_regions>
	<number_of_locations>
	foreach location 1..<no_of_locations>
		<lname> <number_of_persons> <travel_time_to_central_hub>
		foreach person 1..<number_of_persons>
			<pid> <susceptibility> <infection_state>
		endfor
	endfor
endfor
