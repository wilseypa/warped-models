// Purpose : This is a configuration file that the simulation kernel
//           requires for configuring the different components in the 
//           simulation kernel.

// Notes   : Empty lines are ignored; a comment is indicated by a "//".

// Do you want debugging information to be shown
// Note: You will have to build with the -DDEVELOPER_ASSERTIONS flag turned
//       on before you can use this option.
// Choices:
// [a] True or False

// Choices: 
// [a] "Sequential"
// [b] "TimeWarp"

// What type of event set data structure would you like:
// Choices: 
// [a] for Sequential simulation: "SplayTree" or "SingleLinkedList"

// --------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything after this line, is options for TimeWarp simulation

// Choices:
// [a] CENTRALIZED 
// [b] DECENTRALIZED

// Do you want to activate the Control Manager
// Choices:

// Do you want the contents of the ControlManager dumped to file
// Choices:
// [a] "Yes" - contents dumped to file
// [b] "No"  - contents dumped to screen

// What type of State Manager would you like:
// Choices:
// [a] "Periodic" or "Periodic : <state period>"
// (if no state period is specified, state is saved every event execution)
// [b] "Adaptive"
