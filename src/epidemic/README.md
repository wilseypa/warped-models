##Introduction :

This simulation model simulates the epidemic outbreak phenomena. A new 
parallel discrete event formulation of the reaction-diffusion model was 
developed.  It is motivated by the one reported in [2]. The epidemic is 
modeled using a combination of reaction  and diffusion  processes.  The 
reaction  is defined as  a result of  inter-entity  interactions, (e.g. 
influenza or physical proximity). The mobility of the entities leads to 
the  dynamic chances for interactions (e.g., watching movie in a cinema 
and  other co-located  activities). Geographical diffusion  of entities 
provides  chances for  interactions  among  different  sample  sets  of 
entities.

This model contains four parts[1]:

(1) a set of interacting entities.

(2) a network graph that shows the interaction structure of entities. 
    Currently "FullyConnected" and WattsStrogatz" models are supported.

(3) a reaction process, called  within-host  progression  which  models 
    the progress of the disease in an individual entity.

(4) a  diffusion  process,  called   between-host  transmission,  which 
    models the transmission of the disease among individual entities.

NOTE: Network graph design is diffusion model-specific. But to simplify 
distance  calculation  between  locations,  it  has  been  assumed that 
locations are  connected to each  other via a virtual central hub. This 
has been done to reduce  complexity in management of the inter-location 
distances.

Travel time from location 1 to location 2 = 
                     Travel time from location 1 to central hub +
                     Travel time from central hub to location 2


###Important Information :

The  config  file can  be auto-generated  with  random  region  details 
using  the 'configCreation.py'  script.  Type 'python configCreation.py 
<config_file_name>' to create the config file.


##Configuration File :

The model generator program lets the user adjust the following parameters
before writing out the model:

1. Diffusion : model, seed, model parameters
    a. Model Parameters for Watts-Strogatz: K, Beta

2. Disease   : transmissiblity, latent dwell time, latent infectivity, 
               incubating dwell time, incubating infectivity, 
               infectious dwell time, infectious infectivity, 
               asympt dwell time, asympt infectivity, 
               prob_ul_u, prob_ul_v, prob_ur_v, prob_ui_v, prob_ui_u, 
               location state refresh interval, seed

3. Data Capture needed (yes/no)

4. Region    : number of regions
               For each region : region name, number of locations
	           (a) For each location : location name, number of persons, 
                   travel time to central hub, diffusion trigger interval
		           (a.1) For each person : pid, susceptibility, 
                                         is vaccinated, infection state

###Legend :

	Refer to Figure 2 of ref[2] for the disease model
	Transition Probabilities:
		prob_ul_u : uninfected->latent (untreated)
		prob_ul_v : uninfected->latent (vaccinated)
		prob_ur_v : uninfected->recovered (vaccinated)
		prob_ui_v : uninfected->incubating (vaccinated)
		prob_ui_u : uninfected->incubating (untreated)

	Location state refresh interval:
		Intervals at which the disease spread at any location is re-computed
