When the 'testParallelWarped' script is run, it outputs information to files
when the code segment in the TimeWarpSimulationManager::simulate function
is uncommented.

Each processor, or computational node, outputs to its own file. So if a test
run uses 16 processors, a total of 16 output files will be used. Each
output file contains the execution time and number of rollbacks for each
simulation run.

The "analyzer" program takes these output files as input and formats the
result data into an easy to read and easy to transfer table format. Note
that modifying the test script will most likely require modification of
the analyzer program.

This "analyzing" or formatting program can and should probably be changed
to a more easy to modify script. The solution I have added is not the best
but is available anyway.

To build the program just type:
g++ ana.cpp -o analyzer
