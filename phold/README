This application is an implementation of PHOLD developed by Fujimoto.

This application and the makefile expects the rnd/ directory to reside in the test/ 
directory. For now, copy the rnd directory from the old warped implementation.

The phold application does not have a stopping condition and will thus simulate until 
the simulation manager stops the simulation. This can be accomplished with 
the -simulateUntil argument when starting the application.

An example session follows (it is assumed that the reader has the new-warped/test/phold/ 
directory active):
% cd bin
% ./pholdSim -configuration simulation.config -simulateUntil 1500 -simulate default.config

The config file can be used to explicitly declare each object for full customization
or can generate identical objects for large simulations. The type of configuration is given
by GENERATE or LIST.

For LIST, the config file needs to specify the process numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 in the example 
below), starting with 0 and with increments of 1. This is so that the event numbers can be
generated properly in Process::initialize(). The message density is specified as 1000 in 
the example below, the distribution of the random destinations of sent events is exponential 
and the seed is set to 1.0.

The descriptions of the entries for the config file are:
"Number of Processes" "Message Density" "Distribution" "Seed"

LIST

"Name" "ProcessNumber" "State Size" "Computation Grain(in milliseconds)" "Number of Outputs" "Output1" "Output2" ... "OutputN" 
"Name" "ProcessNumber" "State Size" "Computation Grain(in milliseconds)" "Number of Outputs" "Output1" "Output2" ... "OutputN" 
"Name" "ProcessNumber" "State Size" "Computation Grain(in milliseconds)" "Number of Outputs" "Output1" "Output2" ... "OutputN" 
"Name" "ProcessNumber" "State Size" "Computation Grain(in milliseconds)" "Number of Outputs" "Output1" "Output2" ... "OutputN" 

Example default.config file:
=======================
4 1000 EXPONENTIAL 3.0

LIST

PHOLDObject1 0 1024 100 3 PHOLDObject2 PHOLDObject3 PHOLDObject4
PHOLDObject2 1 1024 100 3 PHOLDObject3 PHOLDObject4 PHOLDObject1
PHOLDObject3 2 1024 100 3 PHOLDObject4 PHOLDObject1 PHOLDObject2
PHOLDObject4 3 1024 100 3 PHOLDObject1 PHOLDObject2 PHOLDObject3

For the GENERATE configuration type, the file is as follows:
"Numbers of Processes" "Message Density" "Distribution" "Seed"

GENERATE

"State Size"
"Computation Grain(in milliseconds)"
"Number of Outputs"

Example large.config file:
=======================
1000 1000 EXPONENTIAL 1.0
