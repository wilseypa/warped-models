This directory contains two types of tests, functional tests, and unit tests.
The unit tests are based on cpp_unit and to enable them, configure needed
--with-cpp-unit specified on the command line.  The functional tests
exist in the following libraries:
pingPong
phold

As of this writing, pingPong is the only working functional test.
